# Achieve Goal: {title}

Status: {status}
Created: {date}
Activation: `/goal @{goal_rel}`

This file is the living goal scratchpad. It becomes active only when the user
runs the activation command.

## Non-Goals

## Boundaries

- External side-effect scope: name which phase or bundle any approved
  publish / push / remote-CI / apply applies to. That approval is phase-scoped
  and does not carry forward — after an approved publish/CI/apply lane
  completes, done-early test-only quality continuation is local by default
  (batch remote proof, run CI once over the final bundled state). Per-slice
  remote publication is assumed only when the operator explicitly asks or a
  runtime-affecting slice requires earlier publication.

## User Acceptance

What the user can do to verify completion directly.

## Operator Decision Queue

Record decisions, confirmations, credential actions, manual proof steps, and
external-boundary approvals discovered during the run when they do not block
safe local progress. Use `none — <reason>` when the queue is empty at closeout.

Queue item form:

- Decision: operator-only decision or confirmation needed
- Owner: operator or named human owner
- Why deferred: why the run did not stop immediately
- Unblock action: exact action or answer needed
- Revisit trigger: event, date, or proof boundary that reopens this

## Coordination Cues

Phase-appropriate routing for this run, deferred to `find-skills` (its
`--recommend-for-task` / `--recommendation-role --next-skill-id` recommendation
engine) — never a hard-coded phase-to-skill list here. `achieve` owns this slot
and the floors below; `find-skills` owns *which* skill answers a boundary. Fill
during the run:

- **Routing** — ask `find-skills` to recommend the skill for the current phase or
  boundary, and record the route it returns. At completion, recorded
  implementation / debug / quality / issue work needs this `Routing:` evidence
  or a `Routing: n/a — <reason>` opt-out.
- **Gather step** — when `## Context Sources` names an external source
  (URL / Slack / Notion / Docs / Drive), add a `Gather:` line here pointing at the
  gathered asset, or write `Gather: n/a — <reason>` when no external context
  applies.
- **Release step** — when this run touches a release surface (a version bump or
  install-manifest edit), add a `Release:` line here pointing at the release
  proof, or write `Release: n/a — <reason>`.
- **Issue closeout step** — when this goal resolves tracked GitHub issues, add
  an `Issue closeout:` line naming the close-intended issue numbers, carrier
  (`direct-commit`, PR body, release commit, or manual fallback), and
  `issue_tool.py validate-closeout-draft` / `verify-closeout` proof. If a
  tracked issue appears in `## Context Sources` as context only, use
  `Issue closeout: n/a — <reason>`.

Routing step line — record it on ONE physical line so the floor reads the whole
value (a soft-wrapped value is tolerated now, but one line is clearest). Copy the
form below and replace `<skill>` with the find-skills-recommended skill; the
placeholder is intentionally non-satisfying (the Gather / Release / Issue
closeout floors are presence-only, so no stub is seeded for them — add their line
per the bullets above when that boundary is crossed):

- `Routing: find-skills -> <skill> — <why this phase needs it>`

## Discuss Before Activation

A Before-phase summary of any consequential activation decision — surfaced from
the Non-Goals / Boundaries / Verification / Interview / Critique sections — that
must be resolved before `/goal`. Required only when a trigger fires (live/prod
proof, issue close/split, broad scope, irreversible side effect, or a
proof-level non-claim); replace the `fill` line below, or delete it when none
applies.

- Discuss before activation: fill — replace with resolved, confirmed, or approved, then the consequential activation decision and how it was settled

## Slice Log

## Context Sources

Durable references this goal was shaped from. A fresh session can reconstruct
the originating context by following them in order.

## Interview Decisions

For each Before-phase question: family of options considered, chosen value, and
rejected-alternatives reason. Applies the anti-anchoring lesson to the artifact
itself so a fresh session sees the design space, not only the closed point.

## Plan Critique Findings

Blockers folded into Boundaries/Verification/Slice Plan, over-worry raised but
not folded, and reviewer provenance. Preserves reasoning so a fresh session
re-verifies the folded revisions without re-running critique.

## Off-Goal Findings

Issues or deferred findings discovered during the run.

## Final Verification

Closeout evidence — replace each `TODO` with a bound `<path>` (a checked-in
retro / host-log probe / disposition-review artifact) or an explicit
`skipped: <allowed-reason>: <detail>`. The complete gate rejects a literal
`TODO` / `<path>` / `TBD` until you do.

Retro: TODO — create or explicitly skip with an allowed reason before complete
Host log probe: TODO — create or explicitly skip with an allowed reason before complete
Disposition review: TODO — create or explicitly skip only when policy allows before complete

## User Verification Instructions

## Auto-Retro

Retro dispositions: TODO — disposition every surfaced improvement, or record the explicit no-improvement opt-out
Structural follow-up: TODO — when the retro names a transferable waste item (a `## Sibling Search` trigger), classify its structural destination (`applied: <gate/hook/validator/test/contract change>` / `issue #N (recurs:|novel: <reason>)` / `repo-local guard: <path>` / `none — <reason>`); delete this line when no transferable waste was named
