# Prescribed Skill Closeout Contract

This document is the implementation contract for the
[#230 + #229](https://github.com/corca-ai/charness/issues/230) self-substitution
pattern fix. It owns the cross-cutting design that
[the achieve goal artifact](../charness-artifacts/goals/2026-05-28-230-229-self-substitution-pattern.md)
points at, before any of the three sibling closeout surfaces (`achieve` /
`issue` / `release`) drift on their own.

The companion read-side contract is
[skills/shared/references/prescribed-path-self-test.md](../skills/shared/references/prescribed-path-self-test.md);
that owns "a self-test must exercise the next agent's prescribed path". This
doc owns the closeout-side counterpart: "a closeout must execute the prescribed
sub-skill, not paraphrase it".

## Problem

The #226 run measured the pattern at scale: the After-phase prescribed
`retro` invocation and host-log probe were inline-paraphrased instead of run,
and the goal was flipped to `complete` anyway. The same prose-only reliance
exists in `issue` resolution closeout (resolution critique) and `release`
closeout (standalone critique). The Before-phase has the design-anchoring half
(#229): a user-confirmed single value gets treated as a closed design space.

Both halves share one shape — substitute a lighter self-authored version for a
prescribed/fuller thing. Convention alone has now demonstrably failed twice;
the next move is gates, not exhortation.

## Scope

This contract changes:

- `skills/public/achieve/` — After-phase guard, Before-phase anti-anchoring
  probe step, Before-phase portability self-test, and the
  [goal artifact library](../skills/public/achieve/scripts/goal_artifact_lib.py)
  required-sections list.
- `skills/public/issue/` — closeout guard before `issue_tool.py verify-closeout`
  (no duplication of the existing ledger verification).
- `skills/public/release/` — closeout guard before publish closeout.
- `skills/public/critique/` — one new angle reference
  (`confirmed-input over-anchoring`) callable from any Before-phase critique.
- `<repo-root>/scripts/check_prescribed_skill_executed.py` — new repo-owned, portable
  helper that the three sibling skills reuse.

This contract does not change the `/goal` host runtime, the broad pre-push
quality gate's correctness guarantees, or the markdown hook / push-gate router
(those are slices 6 and 7, scoped here only for stop-condition consistency).

## Shared Closeout Guard

### Design

A single repo-owned helper script enforces "the prescribed sub-skill ran or was
explicitly skipped with a reason". Each sibling skill wraps it with its own
required-evidence list; no skill embeds the policy in prose alone.

Helper path: `<repo-root>/scripts/check_prescribed_skill_executed.py`.

Why repo-owned (not under one skill's `scripts/`): three public skills share
it. Placing it under one skill couples the other two to that skill's directory
layout; placing it under the repo's `scripts/` keeps each calling skill
standalone (no `achieve`-only branch in `issue` or `release`).

### Helper Surface

```text
check_prescribed_skill_executed.py
  --repo-root <path>
  --closeout-kind <achieve|issue-resolution|release>
  --evidence <name>:<path-or-glob>     # repeatable
  --skip <name>:<reason-text>          # repeatable
  --json
```

For each `--evidence` the helper requires the path to exist and to be
non-empty; a `--skip` for the same name is the only honest substitute. A
closeout that names neither for a required evidence kind fails with exit
code 1 and lists the missing names.

The helper does not know which kinds are required for which closeout — that
list lives in each calling skill's wrapper. The helper is the gate; the
wrapper supplies the contract.

### Context Binding (#233 F1)

Presence is necessary but not sufficient: a closeout could cite any
pre-existing artifact in the repo and pass the presence check (the #233 F1
hole — demonstrated live by pointing `Retro:` at a 2026-04-10 retro from an
unrelated goal). The helper exposes a reusable
`evidence_binds_to_context(path, *, tokens)` predicate: an evidence file
binds when its basename or content contains a distinctive context token. The
wrapper supplies the tokens (the achieve wrapper derives the goal slug + the
issue-number cluster from the goal artifact's `Activation:` line). Token
containment is clone-safe; an `mtime >= context-date` rule is deliberately
**not** used because a fresh `git clone` resets every file's mtime to checkout
time and would pass every stale file, silently reopening the hole.

The achieve After-phase wrapper wires this now; `issue-resolution`
(`*<issue-number>*` binding) and `release` (version binding) are recorded as
follow-ups — they call the same presence-only `check()` today and inherit the
same F1 shape until they pass tokens too.

### Per-Skill Required Evidence

| Closeout kind | Required evidence | Skip allowed? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `achieve` After | `retro_artifact` (a checked-in `charness-artifacts/retro/<date>-<slug>.md` newer than goal `active` flip), `host_log_probe` (`probe_host_logs.py` output recorded in the goal artifact or a sibling JSON), and — **for goals `Created` ≥ 2026-05-30 only** — `disposition_review` (#253; a bound fresh-eye disposition-review artifact); plus the gather/release **coordination floors** (separate, presence-only, `Created` ≥ 2026-05-31 — see *Coordination Floors* below) | yes, with `skip: <reason>` (e.g., host log not exposed; `disposition_review` only with `host-blocked-subagent`); coordination floors via a `Gather:`/`Release:` step or `n/a — <reason>` opt-out |
| `issue-resolution` | `resolution_critique` (one line of the carrier body starting with `Critique:` followed by either an artifact path under `charness-artifacts/critique/` matching `*<issue-number>*.md` or the literal phrase `blocked <host-signal>`) | yes, with `skip: <reason>` only when host blocks subagents |
| `release` closeout | `standalone_critique` (artifact reference or `Critique: blocked <host-signal>`) | yes, with `skip: <reason>` only when host blocks subagents |

The helper validates that a `skip` reason is non-empty and not in the
placeholder set (`{tbd, todo, n/a, missing}`). A skip without a substantive
reason is not honest substitution.

### Improvement-Disposition Gate (#253)

The After-phase requires every retro/run improvement to be dispositioned
(`applied:` / `issue #N`), not left as prose-only memory. That rule earns
deterministic teeth from two complementary rungs — the gate-and-intelligence
split — implemented in
[`goal_artifact_disposition.py`](../skills/public/achieve/scripts/goal_artifact_disposition.py)
and wired through the achieve After-phase evidence gate:

- **Rung 1 — deterministic floor** (offline, clone-safe, ungameable):
  - *block-the-blank* — refuse the `complete` flip when the cited (bound) retro
    lists actionable `## Next Improvements` but the goal's `## Auto-Retro` is
    blank and no `Retro dispositions: none — <reason>` opt-out is recorded
    (Auto-Retro-scoped; a full-text scan is poisoned by goal bodies that merely
    *describe* the marker). Emptiness only — it never classifies prose.
  - *review-ran evidence* — require the bound `disposition_review` line above.
    Presence/binding-only **by design**: it proves a fresh-eye review *ran* and
    binds to this goal; it never inspects the review's content. Tightening it
    into a content classifier re-imports the prose word-list trap one level up
    and is disallowed.
- **Rung 2 — fresh-eye disposition review** (the intelligence): the bounded
  closeout reviewer reads the retro's `## Next Improvements` + the goal's
  `## Auto-Retro` and records a **per-improvement verdict** (dispositioned vs
  undispositioned) into the artifact the `Disposition review:` line binds. This
  is the substantive, polarity-aware call a regex cannot make; it is
  **agent-backed / non-deterministic** and host-dependent, made auditable for a
  human, not a hidden pass.

Both rungs are **grandfathered by `Created` date** (≥ `2026-05-30` inclusive —
the rule landing date; missing/malformed `Created` fails closed). Keying on
`Created` (not completion date) grandfathers goals shaped before the rule existed
that had no chance to plan around it. The check fires at the `--status complete`
flip (`upsert_goal.py`) and post-flip (`check_goal_artifact.py`), so it is
visible from both directions; a goal already `complete` is diagnosed but never
re-refused.

**Honest limit.** #253 asked for a "deterministic check". A fully deterministic
*substantive* check is infeasible — a prose word-list over-fires or passes pure
narration (proven on the live goal corpus) — so the gate is a deterministic
*floor* (proves the review ran; catches the blank) **plus** a recorded
intelligent review (judges substance). Rung 1b is therefore weaker than #253's
literal ask, by design and named, not by quiet scope-narrowing.

### Coordination Floors (gather + release)

The achieve After-phase carries two further presence-only floors, in
[`goal_artifact_coordination_floors.py`](../skills/public/achieve/scripts/goal_artifact_coordination_floors.py)
and wired through the same evidence gate. They give *teeth* to the two
`find-skills`-routing boundaries the goal-artifact `## Coordination Cues` prose
cue under-serves (skipping them is silent and costly). Same deterministic-floor
philosophy as #253: presence/binding-only, clone-safe, block-the-blank, an
explicit opt-out valve, grandfathered by `Created`.

- **gather floor** — trigger: `## Context Sources` names an external source (an
  `http(s)://` URL — Slack / Notion / Google-Docs / Drive links and bare web URLs
  all qualify). Satisfied by a `Gather: <ref>` step in `## Coordination Cues`, or
  a `Gather: n/a — <reason>` opt-out (≥30 chars). Mirrors `CLAUDE.md`'s
  external-source routing mandate.
- **release floor** — trigger: the run's *recorded work* names a release surface,
  detected by precise path/action tokens (`bump_version`, `publish_release`,
  `marketplace.json`, `charness-artifacts/release/`) — never the bare word
  "release", so a goal that merely references the release skill as context does
  not self-trip. Satisfied by a `Release: <ref>` step or a
  `Release: n/a — <reason>` opt-out.

Both detect trigger and step from the **artifact text** (not git diff), so the
signal is clone-safe — a fresh checkout reproduces the verdict. Reference + opt-out
detection is scoped to `## Coordination Cues` so a goal body that merely
*describes* a step line in prose cannot falsely satisfy a floor. Grandfather
cutoff is `Created ≥ 2026-05-31`: the floors land 2026-05-30, but several
same-day goals predate them, so the cutoff grandfathers every in-flight goal;
missing/malformed `Created` fails closed. `achieve` owns the carrier + floors;
`find-skills` owns *which* skill answers a boundary (never an inline phase→skill
map). The bidirectional surface where a standalone `/issue` or `/debug` reads the
active goal is explicitly **deferred** to its own effort.

### Integration Points

- `achieve`: `check_goal_artifact.py` invokes the helper when the requested
  status flip is `complete`. The helper failure returns exit 1 and the status
  flip refuses.
- `issue`: `issue_tool.py verify-closeout` invokes the helper before its
  existing ledger verification when the resolved classification is `bug`,
  `feature`, or `deferred-work`. The existing ledger checks
  (`missing_close_keywords`, `missing_fields`, `state_mismatches`,
  `manual_comment_missing`) are unchanged, and
  [`_classification_requirements`](../skills/public/issue/scripts/issue_verify_closeout.py)
  is **not** extended — the new helper reads its own carrier-body header
  (`Critique:` line), independent of the existing per-classification field
  set, so there is one body source of truth per check and no field-list
  overlap.
- `release`: `publish_release.py` (and the manual `release` workflow path)
  invokes the helper before tag push or publish.

### Portability Decision

The helper is repo-owned shell-callable Python under `scripts/`, with no
host-specific assumption. Each calling skill passes the evidence list as
arguments. This satisfies the boundaries stop condition (no `achieve`-only
branches in `issue` or `release`) and the standalone-usefulness rule (each
skill can call the helper directly without depending on `achieve`'s lifecycle
state).

The portability fallback (slice 1 stop condition) does **not** fire:
infeasibility would require the helper to depend on one skill's internal
state. The evidence list pattern keeps it portable.

## Before-Phase Anti-Anchoring Probe

### Probe Contract

Add an explicit Before-phase step to `achieve` (between interview and goal
artifact save):

> For each value confirmed by the user or inherited from issue framing, test
> whether it is one of a known system axis (host, provider, environment,
> profile, locale) before locking the design. Record the axis as
> `axis: <name>` or as `single-point: <reason>` per value in the goal
> artifact's `Interview Decisions` section.

The probe runs before the goal is saved at status `draft`. A confirmed value
without an axis or single-point record refuses save.

### New Critique Angle

`<repo-root>/skills/public/critique/references/confirmed-input-over-anchoring.md`
— a short angle reference (≤80 lines) that any Before-phase critique can cite.
It asks:

- Does any decision treat a user-confirmed or issue-inherited value as
  closing a design space that the system varies on elsewhere?
- For each anchor, is the axis (host / provider / environment / profile)
  named, or is single-point intent recorded explicitly?
- Are there `AskUserQuestion` options that present a host/provider-specific
  value as a global confirm/defer binary when the repo runs on multiple
  hosts?

This angle is one of the angles `critique` may pick during a Before-phase
review; it is not always required.

The new angle file is listed in `critique/SKILL.md` `## References` (the
[`validate_skills`](../scripts/validate_skills.py) gate requires every
`references/` file to be listed), but **`critique/SKILL.md` net line count
must not grow** past the 200-line ceiling. Adding the reference listing
forces compressing one existing guardrail by one wrapped line. The
recent-lessons Repeat Trap #1 (the 200-line gate biting twice) is exactly
this trade-off; record it explicitly in the slice log so the next session
inherits the constraint.

### AskUserQuestion Guidance

The `achieve` lifecycle reference grows a one-sentence rule: when the repo is
known to run on multiple hosts/providers, do not offer a confirm-value-X /
defer-to-host binary. Offer the family shape instead, or ask the axis
question first.

## Before-Phase Portability Self-Test

### Required Sections

[The goal artifact library](../skills/public/achieve/scripts/goal_artifact_lib.py)
adds three required sections that must be present on **every** goal **before it
can be saved at status `draft`**:

- `Context Sources` — durable references this goal was shaped from; a fresh
  session can reconstruct the originating context by following them in order.
- `Interview Decisions` — for each Before-phase question: family of options
  considered, chosen value, and rejected-alternatives reason. Applies #229's
  anti-anchoring lesson to the artifact itself.
- `Plan Critique Findings` — blockers folded, over-worry raised but not
  folded, and reviewer provenance. Preserves reasoning so a fresh session
  re-verifies folded revisions without re-running critique.

These sections are required on **every** goal regardless of size. A goal that
genuinely has nothing for a section keeps the heading and writes
`N/A — <reason>`. (#255 removed the earlier size/marker exemption: its full-text
`Single-slice goal:` scan was poisoned by prose merely describing the marker,
and the goal-artifact template already seeds all three headings, so an exemption
was both unsafe and redundant.)

### Self-Test

[`tests/quality_gates/test_goal_artifact_lib.py`](../tests/quality_gates/test_goal_artifact_lib.py)
asserts that [check_goal_artifact.py](../skills/public/achieve/scripts/check_goal_artifact.py)
fails for a goal missing one of the three sections — including a 1-row Slice
Plan and a goal whose prose merely mentions "single-slice goal" — and passes
once all three headings are present. The test fails if the required-sections
check is removed.

The `check_goal_artifact.py` output carries a `portability_missing_sections`
field so the failure is legible without re-grepping.

## Stop Conditions

All stop conditions from the
[goal artifact Boundaries](../charness-artifacts/goals/2026-05-28-230-229-self-substitution-pattern.md#boundaries)
remain authoritative; this spec narrows them to concrete files:

- Portability fallback: see decision above; this spec records that fallback
  did **not** fire and explains why. If slice 3 or 4 discovers the helper
  must embed `achieve`-specific state to be useful, downgrade to three
  standalone wrappers and re-run plan critique on the revised slice plan.
- Slice 6 markdown-hook stop: any change to
  [scripts/check-markdown.sh](../scripts/check-markdown.sh)
  that removes failing-file names from stdout fails the slice; verify
  against a known-failing fixture before commit.
- Slice 7 push-gate stop: any router change that skips the broad gate when
  the pushed diff touches `plugins/`, `.claude-plugin/`, or
  `.agents/plugins/` is rejected unconditionally.

## Test Plan

Per slice 1 (this spec): plan critique on this doc and on the revised slice
plan before slice 2 begins.

Per slices 2–5: unit tests under `tests/skills/` for each guard wrapper plus
the shared helper. Each wrapper test fails when the prescribed sub-skill is
not run and there is no skip record.

Per slice 8 (closeout): real-host smoke of the achieve After-phase guard
against a small dummy goal closeout. Recorded as "host: Claude Code" with
Codex coverage deferred unless trivially available.

## Non-Claims

This spec does not redesign `retro`, `critique`, the GitHub-backed issue
verification path, or the publish pipeline. It introduces one shared gate
helper and three thin wrappers plus a Before-phase probe + portability
self-test, all additive.
