## Reviewer Tier Evidence

- **Requested tier**: `high-leverage`
- **Requested spawn fields**: `fork_turns=none, model=gpt-5.6-terra, reasoning_effort=medium, service_tier=priority`
- **Host exposure state**: `pending-parent-spawn`
- **Application state**: `unverified-by-packet`
- **Instruction**: Review artifacts must record requested_fields_sent, metadata-hidden, host-defaulted, unsupported, or applied only when host-confirmed.

Read this packet first. Then judge what the deterministic surface leaves uncovered before broad repo sampling.

## Non-Goals For This Contract

- **Section id**: `critique-prepare-non-goals`
- **Content kind**: `static`
- **Producer**: `static-config (inline)`
- **Section ok**: True

```text
- Charness does not classify section roles (source/derived/audit-only/rewrite). Roles stay consumer-defined.
- Charness does not enforce packet content correctness — the validator owns shape only.
- Retro owns its own prepare-packet slot through retro-adapter.yaml packet_sections; critique packets do not substitute for retro lesson judgment.
```

## Semantic Reviewer Question

# Reviewer-Packet Semantic Question

Use this question when a slice changes a guard, reference, claim, or verdict
surface. It keeps a reviewer packet anchored to what a reader or control must
know, rather than to the observable form that happened to expose the problem.

## Ask Before Broad Sampling

The packet author and reviewer should use all four parts when they apply. If a
part is not applicable or cannot be established, record `not applicable` or
`insufficient evidence` with the reason; do not silently claim the control is
proven.

1. **Semantic fact or invariant:** what must be true, independently of the
   current representation or failure spelling?
2. **Owning boundary:** which source, helper, renderer, reference, or workflow
   boundary carries or derives that fact, and who reads it?
3. **Recorded instance:** which concrete observed instance must this slice catch,
   explain, or preserve?
4. **Axis-varying counterexample:** what changes the semantic axis while keeping
   the observed form similar enough to expose a proxy-based control?

The question is a review aid, not a packet-readiness predicate. A clean tree is
not evidence that the selected control catches a recorded instance.

## Compare the Proposed Control

After naming the four parts, state the proposed predicate, claim, or surface
change and compare it with the counterexample:

- If the observed form changes while the semantic fact does not, reject or
  repair a control that changes its verdict with that form.
- If the semantic fact changes while the observed form stays similar, reject or
  repair a control that cannot distinguish the changed outcome.
- If the comparison cannot be made, record `unproven — defer`; do not approve it
  as though a clean-tree result were proof.
- For a behavior-changing helper or command, first record the bounded candidate
  search and scope. When that change has a reader-facing or copy-paste reference
  in scope, identify the first reader and verify that its demonstrated invocation
  preserves the claimed behavior. Disposition each discovered reference as
  updated, not applicable, or insufficient evidence with a reason. If no such
  reference is in scope, record `not applicable` with the search scope; if the
  reader cannot be checked, record `insufficient evidence` or `unproven — defer`
  rather than treating the helper's own tests as proof of reference safety.

These are reviewer dispositions, not an automated semantic gate.

## Decision Boundary

- Prefer a surface fix when the owning surface can carry or derive the semantic
  fact and prove the recorded instance.
- Keep the control as a reviewer question when the fact is judgment-bound or
  cannot be mechanically observed without guessing.
- Add a gate only when the predicate is mechanically observable, its false-fire
  cost is understood, and a recorded escape supports the addition.

This is a reviewer question, not a semantic meta-gate. It does not claim that a
host renders the packet, that a reviewer reaches the right judgment, or that a
clean-tree run proves the control.
