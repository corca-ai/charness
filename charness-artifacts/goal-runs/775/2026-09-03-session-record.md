# Goal Run #775 session record, 2026-09-03

Planning and establishment session. No child was started; the operator deferred
activation to the next session.

## What exists

- Goal Draft `charness-artifacts/goals/2026-09-03-verification-shape-alignment.md`
  (sha256 `6f2f63ecd8264a4502f7feeb9884a2e2cbb5e3f288be22536fd93a2eed010898`),
  interview record beside it (`interview-complete`, ten questions), binding
  `2026-09-03-verification-shape-alignment.binding.json`.
- Parent #775 with metadata block and cursor (revision 1, next
  `awiki-phase-echo` #776). Children: #776 awiki-phase-echo, #777
  layout-resolver, #778 release-lane-standing-evidence, #779
  wall-clock-census-and-764, #780 wall-clock-rewrite-remainder, #781
  lesson-promotion-and-budget, #782 integrated-closeout. `list-sub-issues`
  against `expected-initial-graph.json`: 7 of 7, none missing or unexpected.
  `goal-run-preflight` ready, `goal-run-read` verified, `/goal #775` pickup
  `selected` → #776.

## What was fixed before establishment (outside the goal)

- `1ee5dbc48` achieve SKILL.md: names `interview_contract.py` and the
  pre-approval sequence (framing critique, child bodies, adversarial critique,
  alignment audit, briefing).
- `c781e87d6` issue skill: Work Item key discovery scoped to the parent by the
  provider's `parent_issue_url`; the seventh child had been refused because
  #772 (run #765) carried the same `integrated-closeout` marker. Achieve
  SKILL.md now also records the establishment order: first parent metadata
  through the direct `update` command, then children, then the cursor.

## Next session, in order

1. Read the ledger preview (`--seed goal-775-session1`) and the 2026-09-03
   retro's Next Improvements. Confirm the tree: regenerate the mirror, then
   `python3 scripts/gates_support/run_standing_pytest.py --repo-root .` and
   `./scripts/run-quality.sh --full --read-only`. Only those two are "green".
2. `/goal #775` → #776 awiki-phase-echo. Body in `bodies/awiki-phase-echo.md`;
   the boundary is that `subprocess_guard.py` is untouched.
3. Closeout carrier per child as in run #765 (`Closes #N`, feature, template
   `git show 7f4bcf835 -s`); push from a clean clone; `verify-closeout`; advance
   the cursor with an `update-body` operation under `operations/`.
4. Slice 5 (#781) is a joint per-lesson review with the operator; do not
   apply any lifecycle event before each lesson's reason is settled in
   conversation.
