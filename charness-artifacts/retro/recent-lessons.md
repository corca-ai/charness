# Recent Retro Lessons

## Current Focus

- Implementation session for the activated goal `charness-artifacts/goals/2026-07-08-retro-informed-improvement-5pack.md` (retro-informed-improvement-5pack): five decided slices landed in the hard order R -> V -> B -> G -> D (`6415175b`, `6440b24d`+`30e3dd11`, `cf7e6f47`, `de54a977`, `5d85de98`), plus one inherited pre-goal red-tree repair (`38219d95`). (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-07-08-retro-informed-improvement-5pack-goal-retro.md`)
- Release publish triggered a configured automatic session retro for `v0.61.0`. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-07-04-v0-61-0-release-auto-retro.md`)

## Repeat Traps

- Without the release-helper persistence step, a successful publish can leave a clean tree and make the retro trigger appear unneeded after the fact. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-07-04-v0-62-0-release-auto-retro.md`; sources: 72)
- Slice B repeated a narrower form of the same trap: its focused proof ran only the slice's own test file, and the `args.repo_root` regression in a sibling test file (`test_web_fetch_route_and_classify.py`) was caught by the critique reviewer, not the producer. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-07-08-retro-informed-improvement-5pack-goal-retro.md`)
- Slice G's closeout blocked once on the cautilus skill-review ack and once on the timing-layer table — both were knowable pre-edit from the changed-path surface map; running the aggregate before authoring would have surfaced them in one pass. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-07-08-retro-informed-improvement-5pack-goal-retro.md`)
- The Slice V pre-lock closeout skipped broad pytest and missed the quality-runner stub registration; the miss surfaced only in Slice B's critique broad run and cost a separate debt-fix commit (`30e3dd11`). (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-07-08-retro-informed-improvement-5pack-goal-retro.md`)

## Next-Time Checklist

- Release helper auto-persisted this bounded retro trigger closeout; no additional follow-up is needed for this trigger instance. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-07-04-v0-62-0-release-auto-retro.md`; sources: 72)
- none — no missing tool surfaced; the existing aggregates caught everything the producer missed, just later than ideal. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-07-08-retro-informed-improvement-5pack-goal-retro.md`)
- the spec's dup-ratchet "~1.4s budget" note is stale at HEAD (2.8s pre-existing, +0.24s from algo v2); recorded as an off-goal finding in the goal artifact rather than silently absorbed. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-07-08-retro-informed-improvement-5pack-goal-retro.md`)
- when a slice adds a run-quality gate, a new module, or a new argument on a shared helper, the producer's focused proof must include the registry/importer test files of that surface class (`test_quality_runner.py` for gates; `grep -l` importers for modules), not only the slice's own test file. Applied this session at Slice D (all 9 importer files ran); carried into the goal's slice-log lessons. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-07-08-retro-informed-improvement-5pack-goal-retro.md`)
