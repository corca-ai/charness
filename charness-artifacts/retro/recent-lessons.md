# Recent Retro Lessons

## Current Focus

- Closeout retro for `charness-artifacts/goals/2026-06-26-sustained-quality-speed-token-release.md`: a roughly three-hour quality continuation run covering bug fixes, test runtime, script runtime, token efficiency, and final publication as `v0.56.2`. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-goal-retro.md`)
- Release publish triggered a configured automatic session retro for `v0.56.1`. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-v0-56-1-release-auto-retro.md`)

## Repeat Traps

- Without the release-helper persistence step, a successful publish can leave a clean tree and make the retro trigger appear unneeded after the fact. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-v0-56-3-release-auto-retro.md`; sources: 60)
- A full `python3 -m pytest -q` coverage run was started as a brute-force fallback and then stopped after it became clear it was much slower than the standing-runner path. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-round-2-goal-retro.md`)
- Boundary inventory improvements are useful but can incentivize mechanical conversion. Several remaining candidates were intentionally left because the process boundary is the behavior under test. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-round-3-goal-retro.md`)
- Codex host log probing could bind to `~/.codex/history.jsonl`, but that file did not expose goal-window event records in the same way as the Claude project session JSONL. The probe artifact records this as measured evidence, not as a made-up cost total. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-round-3-goal-retro.md`)

## Next-Time Checklist

- Release helper auto-persisted this bounded retro trigger closeout; no additional follow-up is needed for this trigger instance. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-v0-56-3-release-auto-retro.md`; sources: 60)
- accepted-risk: did not add a new hard gate for advisory requested-review or scenario-registry follow-up in this patch; the release critique records the limitation and deterministic validation owns this release boundary. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-round-2-goal-retro.md`)
- accepted-risk: did not convert Cautilus, web-fetch, release-host, or committed-packaging process boundaries because their remaining subprocesses are the behavior being validated or are safer to keep for release proof. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-round-3-goal-retro.md`)
- applied: added focused fallback tests for timeout/default/error branches and verified changed-line mutation coverage with a fresh coverage fingerprint. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-round-2-goal-retro.md`)
