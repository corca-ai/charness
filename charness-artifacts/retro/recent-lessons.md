# Recent Retro Lessons

## Current Focus

- This retro reviews the goal `charness-artifacts/goals/2026-06-27-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-round-4.md`: a quality slice that split a near-limit test file, removed one `run-quality.sh` help-path startup cost, narrowed prompt-bulk inventory noise, refreshed quality evidence, and completed locked closeout proof. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-27-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-round-4-goal-retro.md`)
- Closeout retro for `charness-artifacts/goals/2026-06-26-sustained-quality-speed-token-release.md`: a roughly three-hour quality continuation run covering bug fixes, test runtime, script runtime, token efficiency, and final publication as `v0.56.2`. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-goal-retro.md`)

## Repeat Traps

- Without the release-helper persistence step, a successful publish can leave a clean tree and make the retro trigger appear unneeded after the fact. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-v0-56-5-release-auto-retro.md`; sources: 62)
- The first prompt-bulk helper patch treated the first string expression inside any AST body as a docstring. Fresh-eye review caught the bug before broad proof, but the first implementation should have limited docstring ownership to module/class/function nodes up front. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-27-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-round-4-goal-retro.md`)
- The new quality artifact initially failed inventory-consumption and durability checks during broad pytest. The fix was simple, but the artifact could have been validated immediately after writing instead of during the locked closeout rerun. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-27-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-round-4-goal-retro.md`)
- A full `python3 -m pytest -q` coverage run was started as a brute-force fallback and then stopped after it became clear it was much slower than the standing-runner path. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-round-2-goal-retro.md`)

## Next-Time Checklist

- Release helper auto-persisted this bounded retro trigger closeout; no additional follow-up is needed for this trigger instance. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-v0-56-5-release-auto-retro.md`; sources: 62)
- After writing a quality current-pointer artifact, immediately run `validate_quality_artifact.py`, `validate_inventory_consumption.py`, `check_spec_evidence_durability.py`, and `validate_current_pointer_freshness.py` before starting locked closeout. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-27-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-round-4-goal-retro.md`)
- When excluding AST docstrings, add a control-flow string-expression test in the first patch, not only after review. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-27-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-round-4-goal-retro.md`)
- accepted-risk: did not add a new hard gate for advisory requested-review or scenario-registry follow-up in this patch; the release critique records the limitation and deterministic validation owns this release boundary. (source: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-26-sustained-quality-speed-token-release-round-2-goal-retro.md`)
