# Release Surface Check
Date: 2026-06-27

## Scope

Advanced `charness` toward release `0.56.8` (tag `v0.56.8`) through the repo-owned release helper.

## Current Version

- previous version: `0.56.7`
- target version: `0.56.8`
- git branch: `main`
- git remote: `origin`

## Verification

- `./scripts/run-quality.sh --release` passed before publish.
- `current_release.py` reported no version drift across packaging and generated install surfaces.
- initial release push carried the release branch update and tag from the release helper.
- post-publish artifact push recorded the verified public release state on the release branch.

## Release State

- local release mutation: complete
- branch/tag push: complete
- GitHub release record: verified URL `https://github.com/corca-ai/charness/releases/tag/v0.56.8`
- public release surface verification: verified
- audit narrative: durable record written to `charness-artifacts/release/latest.md` and committed with this slice

## Public Release Verification

- GitHub release publication: verified by the release backend.

## Distinct-Channel Verification

- Rung-2 distinct-channel verdict: `confirmed` via `https-fetch` (a channel distinct from `gh release view`).
- Channel URL: `https://github.com/corca-ai/charness/releases/tag/v0.56.8`
- HTTP status: `200`
- Rung-1 floor: a per-surface verdict is recorded (presence), so issue closeout was not silent; the honesty of this verdict is the human rung-2 disposition review.

## Release Adapter Preflight

- Release adapter focused preflight status: `not_required`.
- Reason: release adapter did not change in the release delta
- Focused preflight commands: none executed.

## Retro Trigger Evaluation

- Triggered: `True`.
- Evaluated at: `final_release_paths`.
- Input mode: `explicit_paths`.
- Reason: Changed surfaces hit configured install/update/support/export/discovery retro triggers.
- Closeout status: `written`.
- Retro artifact: `charness-artifacts/retro/2026-06-27-v0-56-8-release-auto-retro.md`.
- Recent lessons: `charness-artifacts/retro/recent-lessons.md`.
- Surface hits: 2.
  - `checked-in-plugin-export`
  - `integrations-and-control-plane`
- Path hits: 0.
- Evaluated changed paths: 44.

## Real-Host Verification

- Release-time real-host verification was triggered for this slice.
- Adapter-declared maintainer install-refresh proof was executed by the release helper for installed-vs-repo skew.

## Real-Host Proof

- Release-time real-host proof is required for this slice.
- Executed maintainer install refresh: `charness update` (status `refreshed`, return code `0`).
- Remaining real-host checklist items, if any, still require explicit proof before full closeout.
- On THIS maintainer/dev machine, run `charness update` after publish so the installed plugin at `~/.agents/src/charness` stays `== repo`, then re-verify with `charness doctor` (or `python3 scripts/doctor.py --repo-root . --json`) and a cited-check == repo-gate spot check; record the `charness update` output as executed proof. This closes the installed-vs-repo version-skew class.
- Run `charness tool doctor nose --json --no-write-locks` before installing `nose` and confirm missing `nose` reports `doctor_disposition: advisory-install-needed`, not a blocking install failure.
- Run `charness tool install nose --dry-run --json` and confirm it points at the upstream `nose-cli-installer.sh` release path and latest `v0.4.0` or newer metadata.
- Install `nose` through the manifest-supported path (`charness tool install nose --json`, the upstream release installer, or `brew install corca-ai/tap/nose`), then verify `nose --version`.
- Re-run `charness tool doctor nose --json --no-write-locks` and confirm the binary is detected on PATH.
- Run `charness tool sync-support nose --json` and confirm it reports no materialized support skill requirement; `nose` is an integration-only validation binary consumed by the public `quality` skill.
- Run `python3 skills/public/quality/scripts/inventory_nose_clones.py --repo-root . --json` once with `nose` available and confirm findings, if any, are advisory refactoring candidates rather than standing quality failures.

## Review Proof

- Review proof: `charness-artifacts/critique/2026-06-27-release-0.56.8-d30-fingerprint.md`.

## Requested Review Gate

- Requested-review gate status: `ok`.
- Configuration status: `advisory_only`.
- Policy: `advisory-only`.
- Configured command count: `0`.

## Post-Publish Proof

- Public release check: `gh release view v0.56.8`.

## Install Refresh

- Post-publish install refresh status: `refreshed`.
- Command: `charness update`
- Return code: `0`
- Elapsed seconds: `9.907`
- Stdout tail: `STEP: refreshing source checkout
STEP: refreshing install surface
STEP: refreshing Codex host cache
DONE: update complete
PACKAGE: charness
VERSION: 0.56.7 -> 0.56.8

SCOPE: self

SESSION_STALENESS: cache paths rotated for active sessions
  - local/charness 0.56.7 -> 0.56.8
  -> Updated plugin caches were rotated. Active Codex/Claude sessions may have stale absolute skill paths injected into their system prompt.
