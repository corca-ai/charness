# Release Surface Check
Date: 2026-05-31

## Scope

Advanced `charness` toward release `0.13.2` (tag `v0.13.2`) through the repo-owned release helper.

## Current Version

- previous version: `0.13.1`
- target version: `0.13.2`
- git branch: `main`
- git remote: `origin`

## Verification

- `./scripts/run-quality.sh --release` passed before publish.
- `current_release.py` reported no version drift across packaging and generated install surfaces.
- initial release push carried the release branch update and tag from the release helper.

## Release State

- local release mutation: complete
- branch/tag push: complete
- GitHub release record: target URL `https://github.com/corca-ai/charness/releases/tag/v0.13.2`; creation runs after the branch/tag push
- public release surface verification: not checked by this helper
- audit narrative: durable record written to `charness-artifacts/release/latest.md` and committed with this slice

## Public Release Verification

- GitHub release publication: expected after branch/tag push; not verified yet.

## Real-Host Verification

- This slice still requires configured real-host verification before the release is fully closed.

## Real-Host Proof

- Release-time real-host proof is required for this slice.
- On a second machine or a clean temp-home, refresh `charness` through the published operator path before claiming the release surface is ready.
- Run `charness tool doctor cautilus --json` before installing `cautilus` and confirm the missing-binary state still surfaces an install document URL instead of a guessed package-manager command.
- Follow the official Cautilus install script at `https://github.com/corca-ai/cautilus/blob/main/install.sh`, then verify `cautilus --version` and `cautilus version --verbose`.
- Re-run `charness tool doctor cautilus --json` and confirm the binary is detected on PATH.
- Run `charness tool sync-support cautilus --json`, then confirm the generated support surface exists and the doctor payload reports support as materialized.

## Review Proof

- Review proof: `charness-artifacts/critique/2026-06-01-release-v0.13.2-critique.md`.

## Fresh Checkout Probes

- No repo-declared fresh checkout probes were configured for this release.

## Issue Closeout

- Issue closeout verification: pending or not requested.

## User Update Steps

- Run `charness update` to pull 0.13.2 (maintenance patch: autonomous goal closeout hardening, survivor-test coordination guards, issue/achieve/gather validation floors, and release evidence refresh).
- Restart Claude Code or Codex if the host cache still shows the previous version.
- No new manual migration is required beyond the normal `charness update` flow.
- HOST HOOK CLEANUP - stale or duplicate Codex find-skills startup hook markers are cleaned up during hook reconciliation; if you hand-edited those hooks, inspect the generated config after update.
- AUTO-WIRE WIN (#244/#245) - `charness update` now AUTO-INSTALLS the find-skills SessionStart routing hook and dedups it by logical identity across checkouts. The manual user-level hook wiring required through 0.12.0 is no longer needed; if you hand-added one, you may remove the duplicate.
- BEHAVIOR CHANGE (achieve coordination floors) - a goal `Created` on/after 2026-05-31 now needs a `## Coordination Cues` step before the `complete` flip - a `Gather:` line (or `Gather: n/a — <reason>`) when `## Context Sources` names an external URL/Slack/Notion/Docs source, and a `Release:` line (or `Release: n/a — <reason>`) when the run touched a release surface. Existing and older goals are grandfathered (unaffected). The floors are presence-only and ship with an explicit opt-out, so they never block a goal that records the step.
- BEHAVIOR CHANGE (achieve disposition gate, #253) - a goal `Created` on/after 2026-05-30 also needs a non-blank `## Auto-Retro` and a bound `Disposition review:` line at `complete` (or a `host-blocked-subagent` skip), proving the closeout improvement-disposition review ran. Pre-rule goals are grandfathered.
- Carried-forward (since 0.12.0, still applies) - a bare `/handoff` pickup unions your LIVE open-issue backlog via the resolved issue provider; opt out with `issue_source: {enabled: false}` in `.agents/handoff-adapter.yaml`.
