# Release Surface Check
<!-- charness-release-state:prepared-awaiting-claims-review -->
Date: 2026-08-28

## Scope

Advanced `charness` toward release `8.0.0` (tag `v8.0.0`) through the repo-owned release helper.

## Current Version

- previous version: `7.0.0`
- target version: `8.0.0`
- git branch: `main`
- git remote: `origin`

## Verification

- `./scripts/run-quality.sh --release` is queued for this publish attempt.
- `current_release.py` reported no version drift across 4 versioned surface(s), with 1 presence-only surface(s) not version-checked against target `8.0.0`, checked at `post-bump, pre-commit`.

## Release State

- local release mutation: complete
- branch/tag push: pending independent claims review.
- GitHub release record: pending independent claims review before creation
- public release surface verification: pending independent claims review
- audit narrative: durable record written to `charness-artifacts/release/latest.md` and committed with this slice

## Public Release Verification

- GitHub release publication: expected after branch/tag push; not verified yet.

## Release Adapter Preflight

- Release adapter focused preflight status: `not_required`.
- Reason: release adapter did not change in the release delta
- Focused preflight commands: none planned.
- Focused preflight execution: `not_run`.
- This is a recorded absence, not a passing preflight: no focused adapter check is claimed to have completed successfully for this release.
  - Reason: focused preflight status is `not_required`; no commands were required

## Real-Host Verification

- Release-time real-host verification was triggered for this slice.
- Real-host checklist items remain open until their executed proof is recorded.

## Real-Host Proof

- Release-time real-host proof is required for this slice.
- On THIS maintainer/dev machine, run `charness update` after publish so the installed plugin at `~/.agents/src/charness` stays `== repo`, then re-verify with `charness doctor` and a cited-check == repo-gate spot check; record the `charness update` output as executed proof. This closes the installed-vs-repo version-skew class. Use `charness doctor` here and NOT `python3 scripts/doctor.py --repo-root .`, which is the external-tool doctor and reports nothing about managed-checkout or plugin-root skew; discharging this item with it would record a verification that measured none of what the item is about.
- Run `charness tool doctor nose --no-write-locks` before installing `nose` and confirm missing `nose` reports `doctor_disposition: blocking-install-needed` with an actionable install `next_step`, and that the command itself exits 1. Blocking is CORRECT here: nose.json `degradation.when_missing` records that a missing nose makes the quality `doc-duplicates` phase fail closed with no fallback, and `integrations/tools/README.md` permits `doctor_policy: advisory` only where the consuming workflow has a degraded path. Do NOT read this verdict from `charness doctor`, which is the managed-install doctor and returns 0 regardless of external-tool state; the external-tool verdict comes from `charness tool doctor` or `python3 scripts/doctor.py --repo-root .`. Quoted because the unquoted form parses as a mapping under standard YAML.
- Run `charness tool install nose --dry-run --detail` and confirm it points at the upstream `nose-cli-installer.sh` release path and latest `v0.4.0` or newer metadata. `--detail` is REQUIRED, not optional polish; the summary response level prints neither the installer command nor the release metadata this item asks you to confirm, so the plain `--dry-run` form cannot discharge it.
- Install `nose` through the manifest-supported path (`charness tool install nose`, the upstream release installer, or `brew install corca-ai/tap/nose`), then verify `nose --version`.
- Re-run `charness tool doctor nose --no-write-locks` and confirm the binary is detected on PATH.
- Run `charness tool sync-support nose` and confirm it reports no materialized support skill requirement; `nose` is an integration-only validation binary consumed by the public `quality` skill.
- Run `python3 skills/public/quality/scripts/inventory_nose_clones.py --repo-root . --detail` once with `nose` available and confirm findings, if any, are advisory refactoring candidates rather than standing quality failures.

## Review Status

- Review proof: not recorded in this helper invocation.

## Claims Review

- Claims review: not yet performed -- THIS record is the subject of the pending independent review, and publication is stopped until that review is committed.

## Requested Review Gate

- Requested-review gate status: not recorded by this helper invocation.

## Install Refresh

- Post-publish install refresh: pending final publish verification.

## Release Runtime

- Release helper runtime: not recorded by this helper invocation.

## Fresh Checkout Probes

- Fresh-checkout probes are DECLARED but were not run by this invocation, so no probe verdict was established here.
- `./charness --help >/dev/null`
- `./charness goal run --help >/dev/null`
- `python3 scripts/doctor.py --repo-root . --skip-release-probe >/dev/null`

## Issue Closeout

- Issue closeout verification: pending or not requested.

## User Update Steps

- Run `charness update` to install the latest published Charness release.
- Read the GitHub release notes for release-specific behavior changes, migrations, or rollback notes.


## Bump Rationale

> Major release: public task invocation aliases and repo-local task lifecycle commands are removed, alongside handoff/session-hook, Cautilus, and compatibility-pointer surfaces; existing automation must migrate to the canonical v8 paths.
