# Release Surface Check
Date: 2026-07-26

## Scope

Advanced `charness` toward release `2.11.1` (tag `v2.11.1`) through the repo-owned release helper.

## Current Version

- previous version: `2.11.0`
- target version: `2.11.1`
- git branch: `main`
- git remote: `origin`

## Verification

- `./scripts/run-quality.sh --release` passed before publish.
- `current_release.py` reported no version drift across packaging and generated install surfaces.
- initial release push carried the release branch update and tag from the release helper.
- post-publish artifact push recorded the verified public release state on the release branch.

## Release State

- local release mutation: complete
- branch/tag push: complete
- GitHub release record: verified URL `https://github.com/corca-ai/charness/releases/tag/v2.11.1`
- public release surface verification: verified
- audit narrative: durable record written to `charness-artifacts/release/latest.md` and committed with this slice

## Public Release Verification

- GitHub release publication: verified by the release backend.

## Distinct-Channel Verification

- Rung-2 distinct-channel verdict: `confirmed` via `https-fetch` (a channel distinct from `gh release view`).
- Observer identity: unauthenticated-http (credential-free; same host/process as publisher)
- Channel URL: `https://github.com/corca-ai/charness/releases/tag/v2.11.1`
- HTTP status: `200`
- Rung-1 floor: a per-surface verdict is recorded (presence), so issue closeout was not silent; the honesty of this verdict is the human rung-2 disposition review.

## Lifecycle Usage Capture

- Lifecycle capture status: `appended`.
- Local telemetry pair appended: `True`.
- Delivery episode ID: `episode-7b4be9c0070056e129e5ea6fafdcf7099d31aa346c281f651fbb06df7b0e49c1`.
- Linked feedback ID: `feedback-bc43c1568641f373be96354560c851f9143183b3464cac53c254506106c7206b`.
- Capture error count: `0`.
- Non-claim: objective lifecycle capture is not human approval or general satisfaction evidence.

## Release Adapter Preflight

- Release adapter focused preflight status: `not_required`.
- Reason: release adapter did not change in the release delta
- Focused preflight commands: none executed.

## Retro Trigger Evaluation

- Triggered: `True`.
- Evaluated at: `final_release_paths`.
- Input mode: `explicit_paths`.
- Reason: Changed surfaces hit configured install/update/support/export/discovery retro triggers.
- Closeout status: `written`.

## Baton Reconcile

- Baton reconcile observation: `stale` for `docs/handoff.md`.
- Just-published version: `2.11.1`.
- Versions claimed by the baton's routing sections: `2.11.0`.
- RECONCILE REQUIRED: Reconcile `docs/handoff.md` (its `## Current State` / `## Next Session` routing sections) to the just-published `2.11.1`, or record an explicit n/a disposition in the release record, before ending the session.
- This is an observation, not completion: the populated record forces the reconcile question; the release critique/retro reviewers judge the disposition.

## Release Observer Record

- Durable observer record: `charness-artifacts/probe/2026-07-26-v2.11.1-release-observer.json`.
- Installed readback disposition: `observed`.
- Verdict ownership: this record embeds `distinct_channel_verification`; it does not declare a second release-success verdict.

## Fresh Checkout Probes

- Fresh-checkout probe status: passed.
- `./charness --help >/dev/null`
- `./charness goal check --help >/dev/null`
- `python3 scripts/doctor.py --repo-root . --json --skip-release-probe >/dev/null`

## Issue Closeout

- Issue closeout verification: `not_requested`.

## User Update Steps

- Run `charness update` to install the latest published Charness release.
- Read the GitHub release notes for release-specific behavior changes, migrations, or rollback notes.
