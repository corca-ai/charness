# Achieve Goal: Make a repair prove it does not carry the class it repairs, then finish the corpus

Status: draft
Created: 2026-08-20
Activation: `/goal @charness-artifacts/goals/2026-08-20-repairs-that-carry-their-class.md`

This file is the living goal scratchpad. It becomes active only when the user
runs the activation command.

## Active Operating Frame

- Current slice: real draft/backlog awaiting activation.
- Current slice intent: real draft/backlog awaiting activation; reshape before
  activating if the acceptance boundary has changed. Once active, this names
  the reviewable-intent unit in progress and the commits it spans; critique
  and broad proof do not re-fire within one unchanged intent — update it when
  the intent changes, not per commit (meaningful-slice-cadence).
- Next action: activate with `/goal @charness-artifacts/goals/2026-08-20-repairs-that-carry-their-class.md` after confirming the draft is
  still intended.
- Verification cadence: cheap deterministic checks at commit boundaries;
  higher-cost or fresh-eye proof at slice boundaries; final broad/live proof at
  closeout.
- Gate cadence: pre-lock slices use `run_slice_closeout.py --skip-broad-pytest`;
  final/bundle proof records the verification lock and uses `--verification-lock`.
- Slice review packet: before fresh-eye slice critique, provide intent, changed
  files and owning/generated surfaces, expected invariants, tests/proof,
  non-claims, out-of-scope lines, and reviewer questions.
- History boundary: keep this frame current; move completed detail to
  `## Slice Log`, `## Operator Decision Queue`, `## Final Verification`,
  and `## Auto-Retro`.

## Goal

This run's predecessor measured the same failure SIX times across three unrelated surfaces in one goal: a probe-record detector whose variant generator emitted the exact malformed shape it was built to catch; an adapter loader whose unregister repair reproduced the second-error-hides-the-first shape its own comment names; a census gate that forbade a legitimate chain and so produced a manifest quietly omitting a real caller. Every one was found by the SECOND bounded round, which is the most expensive detector this repo owns.

The thesis is the predecessor's own retro conclusion, one level up from where it left it. The predecessor built the tool that thirteen review rounds had paid for by hand, and the tool worked -- it found a fifth dead control no round had. But the ROUNDS were still what caught the repairs, and six rounds across three slices is roughly the same bill the predecessor set out to stop paying.

Slice 1 is the affordance: when a slice's diff adds a REFUSAL, name the input class it refuses and ask, mechanically, whether the repair's own new code contains that class. Slice 2 spends it on the two known instances that are still open -- `covering_rows` is an enumerated set no witness verifies in either direction, and 55 `safe-checks-errors` rows carry one token over materially different coverage exactly as `guarded` did before it was split.

Slices 3 and 4 are the predecessor's unfinished remainder: the SEVENTEEN adapter-consumer rows it stopped before rather than measuring under a half-built vocabulary (recounted with `check_adapter_consumer_classification.py`, not read off the predecessor's prose — which is that goal's own recorded lesson), and its slice 6 (two-round bookkeeping as typed critique fields, `#628` to the operator queue). They come AFTER the tooling for the same reason the predecessor put its detector first: paying rows under a mechanism that cannot see its own defects buys another six rounds spent on repairs.

## Non-Goals

## Boundaries

- External side-effect scope: name which phase or bundle any approved
  publish / push / remote-CI / apply applies to. That approval is phase-scoped
  and does not carry forward — after an approved publish/CI/apply lane
  completes, done-early test-only quality continuation is local by default
  (batch remote proof, run CI once over the final bundled state). Per-slice
  remote publication is assumed only when the operator explicitly asks or a
  runtime-affecting slice requires earlier publication.

## User Acceptance

What the user can do to verify completion directly — the OUTCOMES, not the
verification cadence. Whichever line of `## Active Operating Frame` states when
broad or expensive proof runs (`Gate cadence:` in the charness default frame; a
consumer adapter may seed its own) is the one owner of that answer. Restating it
here creates a second owner, and an agent reading its own acceptance criteria
obeys the acceptance criteria: one measured session paid roughly two and a half
hours re-running a 12-minute suite that way. Name what is true when the goal is
done, and point at `## Active Operating Frame` for when it is proven.

## Operator Decision Queue

Record decisions, confirmations, credential actions, manual proof steps, and
external-boundary approvals discovered during the run when they do not block
safe local progress. Use `none — <reason>` when the queue is empty at closeout.

Queue item form:

- Decision: operator-only decision or confirmation needed
- Owner: operator or named human owner
- Why deferred: why the run did not stop immediately
- Unblock action: exact action or answer needed
- Revisit trigger: event, date, or proof boundary that reopens this

## Coordination Cues

Phase-appropriate routing for this run, chosen from installed skill metadata and
model judgment — never a hard-coded phase-to-skill list here. Use the catalog
only for hidden availability facts. `achieve` owns this slot and the floors
below. Fill during the run:

- **Phases** — name the phases this run's recorded work crossed, e.g.
  `Phases: debug, quality`, or `Phases: n/a — <reason>` when it crossed none. YOU
  say this; the floor used to infer it by matching words in your prose and was
  wrong in both directions — plain-English debug work did not register, while the
  word "gate" in an unrelated sentence demanded a quality route.
- **Routing** — choose the skill for the current phase or boundary from installed
  metadata/model judgment, and record the route. At completion, recorded
  implementation / issue work (both detected from records you wrote) and every
  phase you declared above need this `Routing:` evidence or a
  `Routing: n/a — <reason>` opt-out.
- **Gather step** — when `## Context Sources` names an external source
  (URL / Slack / Notion / Docs / Drive), add a `Gather:` line here pointing at the
  gathered asset, or write `Gather: n/a — <reason>` when no external context
  applies.
- **Release step** — when this run touches a release surface (a version bump or
  install-manifest edit), add a `Release:` line here pointing at the release
  proof, or write `Release: n/a — <reason>`.
- **Issue closeout step** — when this goal resolves tracked GitHub issues, add
  an `Issue closeout:` line naming the close-intended issue numbers, carrier
  (`direct-commit`, PR body, release commit, or manual fallback), and
  `issue_tool.py validate-closeout-draft` / `verify-closeout` proof. If a
  tracked issue appears in `## Context Sources` as context only, use
  `Issue closeout: n/a — <reason>`.
- **Successor goal step** — required at EVERY completion, not conditionally. Add
  a `Successor goal:` line naming the next goal artifact this run's lessons
  designed, or write `Successor goal: n/a — <reason>` to say out loud that none
  is wanted. The closing goal is the only place that still holds what the session
  measured about this repo's real shape; a completion that does not spend it
  throws that away, and the next session re-derives it.

Routing step line — record it on ONE physical line so the floor reads the whole
value (a soft-wrapped value is tolerated now, but one line is clearest). Copy the
form below and replace `<skill>` with the selected installed skill; the
placeholder is intentionally non-satisfying (the Gather / Release / Issue
closeout floors are presence-only, so no stub is seeded for them — add their line
per the bullets above when that boundary is crossed):

- `Phases: <declared phases, or n/a — why none were crossed>`
- `Routing: <skill> — <why this phase needs it>`

## Discuss Before Activation

A Before-phase summary of any consequential activation decision — surfaced from
the Non-Goals / Boundaries / Verification / Interview / Critique sections — that
must be resolved before `/goal`. Required only when a trigger fires (live/prod
proof, issue close/split, broad scope, irreversible side effect, or a
proof-level non-claim); replace the `fill` line below, or delete it when none
applies.

- Discuss before activation: fill — replace with resolved, confirmed, or approved, then the consequential activation decision and how it was settled

## Slice Log

## Context Sources

Durable references this goal was shaped from. A fresh session can reconstruct
the originating context by following them in order.

1. TODO the repo's governing design standard, and what it says about THIS goal —
   which facets bear on its boundaries, where its teeth belong, and which
   irreversible boundaries it crosses. Read it while SHAPING, not at closeout:
   the standard is what tells you where a wrong answer escapes, and that is a
   Before-phase question. (The retro's `## North Star Alignment` asks the
   backward-looking half; this is the forward-looking one.)

## Interview Decisions

For each Before-phase question: family of options considered, chosen value, and
rejected-alternatives reason. Applies the anti-anchoring lesson to the artifact
itself so a fresh session sees the design space, not only the closed point.

## Plan Critique Findings

Blockers folded into Boundaries/Verification/Slice Plan, over-worry raised but
not folded, and reviewer provenance. Preserves reasoning so a fresh session
re-verifies the folded revisions without re-running critique.

## Closeout Binding Plan

Shape these minimum fields before activation and keep them current. The field
check proves shape only; closeout workflows prove the values and identities:

- Reviewed inputs: name semantic goal/issue/quality inputs; retro, packet, reviewer, and lock records are terminal evidence.
- Frozen target: commit the semantic baseline, then bind the packet to that exact commit SHA.
- Fresh-eye: name a distinct reviewer and a different observer/evidence channel.
- Verification lock: name the lock command and evidence location; semantic input edits require rebinding.
- Complete flip: record packet/reviewer/lock evidence, then write terminal status/evidence bookkeeping outside the reviewed identity.

## Off-Goal Findings

Issues or deferred findings discovered during the run.

## Final Verification

Closeout evidence — replace each `TODO` with a bound `<path>` (a checked-in
retro / host-log probe / disposition-review artifact) or an explicit
`skipped: <allowed-reason>: <detail>`. The complete gate rejects a literal
`TODO` / `<path>` / `TBD` until you do.

Retro: TODO — create or explicitly skip with an allowed reason before complete
Host log probe: TODO — create or explicitly skip with an allowed reason before complete
Disposition review: TODO — create or explicitly skip only when policy allows before complete

## User Verification Instructions

## Auto-Retro

Retro dispositions: TODO — disposition every surfaced improvement, or record the explicit no-improvement opt-out
Structural follow-up: TODO — when the retro names a transferable waste item (a `## Sibling Search` trigger), classify its structural destination (`applied: <gate/hook/validator/test/contract change>` / `issue #N (recurs:|novel: <reason>)` / `repo-local guard: <path>` / `none — <reason>`); delete this line when no transferable waste was named
